# .netWikiGame

This game uses Javascript, AJAX, Jquery and the Wikipedia API. The rules are simple: select a wikipedia target entry and then hit the start button. 
Wikigame will return a random wikipedia entry to you: your goal is to try to click on the least number of links betweem the random entry and your target wiki. Have fun!
